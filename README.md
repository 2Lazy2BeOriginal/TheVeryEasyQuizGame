# About
Welcome to our Game Show! Here we ask five basic questions and see if you really are smart enough to be a five year old or a very corrupt four year old.
<br>
These questions may seem trivial however the host of the questionaire is ran by someone with anger problems (and didn't grow up loved) and doesn't take kindly to friendly trolling. Don't try to stir up drama with the host (who is asking the questions by text) or he will intentionally sabotage your playthrough in remarkable ways. 
There are 20 endings
  - 9 main endings
  - 5 easter egg endings
  - 2 *unconventional endings*
<br> All possible ways of causing drama among you and the host are accounted for! Think you can pass our quiz with flying colours?
